# nvim

This is my current neovim config!

I'm using [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) for a semi-minimal setup with a lot of nice defaults configured for you. Been super happy with it so far!

I've also really enjoyed [LazyVim for Ambitious Developers](https://lazyvim-ambitious-devs.phillips.codes/course/chapter-3/), a great resource to get started with not only LazyVim but Neovim in general.

[TypeCraft's video's](https://www.typecraft.dev/) have also been really useful (and entertaining!).
